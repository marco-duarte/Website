abstract: "Understanding the nature of firm competition is of first order importance. In the empirical literature, researchers have used several different procedures to test two alternative models of firm conduct. In this paper, we formally compare the properties of these procedures, contrasting those designed for model assessment with those that perform model selection. In the absence of data on marginal costs, tests rely on a moment condition that must be formed using valid excluded instruments, e.g. demand rotators. We extend the intuition in Bresnahan (1982) and show that the testability condition in Berry and Haile (2014) requires - in a parametric environment - that the two candidate models generate different projections of markups on instruments. Without model misspecification, we show that a partial ranking in power exists among testing procedures in this setting. We then turn attention to the empirically relevant setting where either demand or cost is misspecified. Here we discuss the limitations of procedures designed to perform model assessment relative to model selection. With enough data, model assessment
procedures will reject true models of conduct even for a small amount of demand or cost misspecification. However, the test developed in Rivers and Vuong (2002) may still be capable of selecting the true model."
