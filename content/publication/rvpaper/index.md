abstract: "We study inference on firm conduct without data on markups. Berry and Haile (2014) provide a testability condition requiring instruments. Implementing a test using this condition involves choosing both hypotheses and instruments, which affect inference. While the IO literature has adopted model selection and model assessment approaches to formulating
hypotheses, we present the advantages of the Rivers and Vuong (2002) (RV) model selection test under misspecification. However, the RV test may suffer from degeneracy, whereby inference is invalid. We characterize degeneracy as a weak instruments problem via a novel definition of
weak instruments for testing. This characterization enables us to provide a diagnostic for reliable inference. We illustrate our results in the setting of Villas-Boas (2007). We test conduct with three standard sets of instruments, one strong and two weak. Weak instruments cause the RV test to have no power. With strong instruments, models of double marginalization are rejected."
