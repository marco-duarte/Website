abstract: "We analyze a hub-and-spoke cartel in the Brazilian automotive fuel industry. Using the court documents and detailed data on the supply chain we uncover the mechanisms used by gas stations and fuel distributors to solve the obstacles of price coordination. The evidence shows that a subset of distributors (hub) helped the stations (spokes) to overcome coordination problems in three ways: (i) allowing for transfers between geographically dispersed stations (ii) punishing defectors by offering wholesale price discounts to the defectorâ€™s close competitors; and (iii) reducing the frequency of price changes and asymmetries between stations by diverging sales to the product with stable costs. We argue that the hub benefited from the cartel by being the exclusive supplier during the scheme. We use the synthetic control approach to quantify how successful the cartel was in generating higher mark-ups. We find that not only retailers, but wholesalers benefited from the cartel."
