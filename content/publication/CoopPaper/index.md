abstract: "Although consumer cooperatives are nominally operated in the interest of their members, their governance structure may allow managers to pursue their own objectives. This article tests empirically whether consumer cooperatives act as profit-maximizing agents. Using data and a structural model, we investigate whether the hypothesis of profit maximization can be rejected for consumer cooperatives operating in the Italian supermarket industry. We do not find significant deviations of cooperativesâ€™ conduct from profit maximization. Counterfactual simulations indicate that full internalization of consumer surplus by cooperatives would increase consumer surplus by about 6% in the market we study."
