abstract: "A hub-and-spoke cartel, where firms' constraint competition with the help from an upstream supplier or a downstream buyer, is a type of collusive arrangement observed in a variety of industries. The recent literature focuses on information sharing as the main mechanism through which a hub can help spokes to coordinate. We show that when asymmetries in horizontal differentiation across spokes exist, the hub can also use wholesale price differences to help spokes achieve higher prices. We present evidence that this mechanism was used during a hub-and-spoke cartel between gas stations and distributors in the Brazilian gasoline industry. We also estimate a structural model of demand for gasoline and retail price collusion to quantify the importance of the wholesale price strategy for the stability of the cartel. We find that in the absence of the hub's wholesale price strategy, gas stations would need to decrease the coordinated overprice in 40% to sustain collusion."
